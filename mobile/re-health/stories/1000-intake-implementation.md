# Intake Screen Implementation

## Story Reference
Story ID: 1000
Title: Implement Intake Screen with Component-Driven Architecture

## Overview
Create the Intake screen as a central hub for managing fasting schedules and viewing daily diet protocols using a component-driven architecture.

## Business Value
- Users can track their fasting schedule
- Users can view their current diet day and meal protocols
- Clear organization helps users follow the re-health protocol accurately

## Technical Solution
The implementation will follow a component-driven architecture with the following structure:

### Component Hierarchy
```
IntakeScreen
├── FastingTimer/
│   ├── FastingTimerContainer
│   ├── TimerDisplay
│   ├── TimeInput
│   └── TimerControls
├── DietStatus/
│   ├── DietStatusContainer
│   ├── DayIndicator
│   ├── NextDayPreview
│   └── ProgressTracker
└── MealProtocol/
    ├── MealProtocolContainer
    ├── DailyMealList
    ├── MealCard
    └── ProtocolGuide
```

### Key Features
1. Fasting Timer
   - Custom end time input
   - Countdown display
   - Start/End controls
   - Persistent timer state

2. Diet Status Display
   - Current day indicator (Day 1-5, Loading, or Refeed)
   - Next day preview
   - Diet cycle progress tracking

3. Meal Protocol Display
   - Day 1-3: One meal (high protein, moderate fat, low carb)
   - Day 4: Two meals (lean protein + green vegetables)
   - Day 5: Three meals (lean protein + green vegetables)
   - Loading Day: Low-glycemic carbs focus
   - Refeed Day: Normal eating guidance

### Technical Requirements
- Use React Native components
- Implement AsyncStorage for persistence
- Use Expo Router for navigation
- Follow component-driven design principles
- Maintain clean separation of concerns
