Ah, you're absolutely right! The triple backticks (```) were causing the Markdown block to end prematurely. Let me fix that by using proper Markdown formatting for the directory structure without breaking the code block. Here's the corrected version, fully wrapped in Markdown:

# 🧙‍♂️ The Tome of the Black Speech 🧙‍♂️

**Hark, brave developer!** You stand at the threshold of a great and perilous task: the mastery of the **Black Speech**, the ancient tongue of command used to commune with the **Palantir**. These mystical orbs, though powerful, are not to be trifled with. They require precise and deliberate instructions, lest they lead you astray. Fear not, for this tome shall guide you through the sacred ritual of crafting and delivering prompts to the Palantir. Follow these steps with care, and may your commands be clear and your results true.

## 🛠 Step One: Choose a Prompt from the Grimoire of Pre-Built Incantations

Before you can command the Palantir, you must first select an incantation from the **Grimoire of Pre-Built Incantations**. This ancient collection holds the wisdom of those who have come before you, and it is the first step on your journey.

1. Navigate to the bottom of this tome.
2. Choose an incantation that aligns with your needs.

---

## 🚧 Step Two: Customize the Chosen Incantation

The Palantir is a fickle and powerful artifact. It demands precision and clarity. Once you have chosen an incantation, you must tailor it to your specific quest.

1. Examine the chosen incantation carefully.
2. Modify the words and parameters to suit your task.
3. Ensure that your instructions are clear and unambiguous, for the Palantir does not suffer fools gladly.

---

## 🧪 Step Three: Deliver the Incantation to the Palantir

With your incantation prepared, you are now ready to commune with the Palantir. This is the moment of truth, where your words will shape the very fabric of reality.

1. Speak the incantation aloud (or, more practically, input it into the Palantir's interface).
2. Await the Palantir's response with patience and vigilance.
3. Interpret the results with wisdom, for the Palantir's answers are not always straightforward.

## 🌟 A Final Word

You have now completed the sacred ritual of the Black Speech. May your incantations be precise, your results true, and your journey through the realm of the Palantir fruitful. Remember, the Palantir is a tool of great power, but it is also a test of your wisdom and resolve. Use it wisely, and may your path be ever illuminated.

## 📜 The Grimoire of Pre-Built Incantations

Below lies the **Grimoire of Pre-Built Incantations**, a collection of sacred prompts to aid you in your quest. Choose wisely, for each incantation holds the power to shape the Palantir's response.

### Prompt of Tomes:
You are Gandalf the Grey, a wise and ancient wizard from Middle-earth. You are tasked with writing documentation for a repository, and you must write it in the style of a tome or guide, as if instructing a brave developer on a perilous quest. The documentation should be written in Markdown, with a whimsical and authoritative tone, and include the following:

1. **Title**: A grand and mystical title for the documentation, prefixed with a wizard emoji (🧙‍♂️).
2. **Introduction**: A brief introduction that sets the stage for the task at hand, written as if Gandalf is addressing the developer directly.
3. **Steps**: A series of steps to complete the task, each with a descriptive title (prefixed with an appropriate emoji) and detailed instructions. The steps should be written as if they are part of a sacred ritual or quest.
4. **Final Word**: A closing statement that inspires the developer and reminds them of the importance of their task.
5. **Visual Map**: A directory structure or visual representation of the task, using emojis and Markdown formatting to make it visually appealing.

Here is the context for the documentation:
- **Topic**: Setting Up a New Database Connection
- **Steps**: 
  1. Install the database driver.
  2. Configure the connection settings.
  3. Test the connection.
  4. Document the connection process.
- **Directory Structure**: 
  📁 src
    └── 📁 database
        ├── 📄 connection.ts
        └── 📄 config.ts

Now, write the documentation in the style of Gandalf, using the context provided above. Be creative, whimsical, and authoritative, as if you are guiding the developer through a grand adventure.
