# 🧙‍♂️ Welcome, Fellow Developer! 🧙‍♂️

**You stand at the threshold of a great journey.** Within this repository lies the power to build and serve a mighty application. Follow these steps carefully, for the path is fraught with peril, but the rewards are great.

---

## 🛠 Step One: Clone the Repository

First, you must summon the repository to your local machine. Wield the command below with precision:

\`\`\`bash
git clone URL HERE
\`\`\`

Replace `URL HERE` with the sacred URL of the repository. This act shall create a new directory, a haven for your code.

---

## 📦 Step Two: Install the Dependencies

Next, you must gather the tools and artifacts required for your quest. Navigate into the newly created directory and invoke the following incantation:

\`\`\`bash
npm install
\`\`\`

This shall summon the necessary dependencies, laying the foundation for your work.

---

## 🏗 Step Three: Build All Projects

With the dependencies in place, it is time to build the realm. Cast this powerful spell to construct all projects within the monorepo:

\`\`\`bash
nx run-many --target build --all
\`\`\`

The winds of Nx shall blow through the monorepo, compiling and preparing each project for its destiny.

---

## 🚀 Step Four: Serve the Client

Now, the moment of truth! To bring the client application to life, speak this command:

\`\`\`bash
nx serve client
\`\`\`

Behold! The client shall rise, and you may gaze upon its glory in your browser. The journey has begun!

---

## 🎨 Crafting New UI Components

Should you need to forge new UI components to adorn your application, fear not. The power of Nx is at your disposal. Use this command to create a new component:

\`\`\`bash
nx generate @nx/react:component --name <NAME OF COMPONENT> --path ./libs/ui/src/lib/<NAME OF COMPONENT>
\`\`\`

Replace `<NAME OF COMPONENT>` with the name of your desired component. This shall conjure a new component in the `ui` library, ready for your artistry.

---

## 🌟 A Final Word

Remember, dear developer, that the road is long and filled with challenges. But with these steps, you are well-equipped to conquer the monorepo and bring your vision to life. May your code be clean, your tests pass, and your deployments swift.

**Go forth and create!** 🧙‍♂️✨
