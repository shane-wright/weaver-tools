### **1. Autophagy: The Cellular "Spring Cleaning"**  
Autophagy is your body’s way of recycling damaged cells, proteins, and mitochondria. Boost it to:  
- **Reverse cellular aging**  
- **Reduce inflammation**  
- **Clear out dysfunctional components** (like zombie cells)  

#### **How to Trigger It Deeply**  
**A. Fasting Protocols:**  
- **16/8 Intermittent Fasting (Daily):** Easy entry; eat within an 8-hour window.  
- **24-36 Hour Fast (1-2x/week):** More autophagy, growth hormone spike.  
- **3-5 Day Fast (Quarterly):** Resets immune stem cells (Dr. Valter Longo’s research).  
  *Pro Tip:* Drink **electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium)** to avoid fatigue.  

**B. Autophagy-Boosting Supplements/Nutrients:**  
- **Spermidine** (in wheat germ, aged cheese) – mimics fasting.  
- **Turmeric/Curcumin** – enhances autophagy pathways.  
- **Green Tea (EGCG)** – ups cellular cleanup.  

**C. Exercise Synergy:**  
- **Train fasted** (morning cardio or resistance work) to amplify autophagy.  
- **Sauna after fasting** – heat shock proteins + autophagy = super-repair.

### **2. Animal Flow: Rehabilitate Like a Primate**  
Animal Flow is **movement-based rehab**—improving mobility, joint resilience, and neuromuscular control by mimicking animals. Unlike gym routines, it:  
- **Restores natural movement patterns** (lost from sitting)  
- **Rebuilds connective tissue** (tendons, fascia)  
- **Enhances body awareness (proprioception)**  

#### **Key Movements for Rejuvenation**  
**A. Foundational Flow (Daily Practice):**  
1. **Bear Crawl** – Resets shoulder/scapula stability.  
2. **Crab Reach** – Opens thoracic spine, counteracts hunching.  
3. **Ape Swings** – Dynamic hip mobility + core tension.  
4. **Scorpion Reach** – Rotational spine health.  

**B. Advanced Rehab Tweaks:**  
- **Slow Eccentrics** (e.g., 5-second descent in Crab walks) – builds tendon strength.  
- **Paused Isometrics** (hold Beast Pose for 30 sec) – deep core/joint stabilization.  

**C. Programming:**  
- **10-15 mins daily** (grease the groove) > 1 long session weekly.  
- **Pair with fasting** – movement enhances autophagy’s effects.

### **Synergy Between Autophagy + Animal Flow**  
1. **Fast + Flow Morning Routine:**  
   - Wake up, hydrate with electrolytes.  
   - 10 min Animal Flow (primal movements in fasted state).  
   - Follow with sauna/cold shower.  
   *Result:* Autophagy cleans cells; Animal Flow rebuilds movement integrity.  

2. **Post-Workout (Fed State) Mobility:**  
   - After eating, do **loaded Animal Flow** (wear a weighted vest) to strengthen new cells.  

3. **Recovery Days:**  
   - 24-hour fast + **only Animal Flow + stretching** – no heavy training.

### **Key Notes for Elite Performance**  
- **Fasted?** Focus on **slow eccentrics** (e.g., 3-sec Crab Reach descents) to amplify autophagy.  
- **Weighted?** Add a **5-10lb vest** to Beast/Crab movements for strength stimulus.  
- **Rehab Priority:** Spend extra time on **Scorpion Reach** if desk-bound, **Beast Pull-Through** if shoulders are fatigued from training.  

Need modifications for a specific goal (e.g., more hip focus, less wrist demand)?
