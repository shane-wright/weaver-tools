# Business Ask and Application Narrative

## Business Ask
The Star Wars Side-Scroller is a personal-use desktop game designed to deliver an immersive, Star Wars-themed arcade experience. The project leverages Tauri to create a lightweight, cross-platform desktop application using web technologies, enhanced with custom Star Wars assets (sprites and audio). The goals are to:
- Create an engaging side-scrolling shooter where players control an X-Wing to battle TIE Fighters, complete with thematic sprites and sound effects.
- Showcase Tauri’s capabilities for building efficient desktop apps with web technologies (HTML, JavaScript, Canvas API).
- Provide a proof-of-concept for integrating custom assets (PNG sprites, MP3 audio) in a Tauri-based game.
- Deliver a fun, nostalgic experience for Star Wars fans, with assets that evoke the franchise’s iconic aesthetic.
- Maintain extensibility for future features (e.g., levels, power-ups) while keeping the codebase modular.
- Ensure assets are created or sourced legally for personal use, avoiding any distribution to respect Star Wars IP.

The game is for private use, targeting the developer’s enjoyment and experimentation with Tauri and game development. It will not be published or distributed.

## Application Narrative
**The Galactic Rebellion Begins**

In a galaxy far, far away, you are a Rebel pilot commanding an X-Wing starfighter in a high-stakes mission against the Galactic Empire. Your task: navigate through a star-filled void, blasting TIE Fighters with laser fire while dodging their relentless advance. Each TIE Fighter you destroy bolsters the Rebellion’s cause, but a single collision could end your mission. With the Empire’s forces closing in, your reflexes and precision are the galaxy’s last hope.

The **Star Wars Side-Scroller** brings this epic battle to life with custom Star Wars-themed assets: a detailed X-Wing sprite, menacing TIE Fighter sprites, glowing laser effects, and immersive sound effects for laser shots and explosions. Rendered in a 2D canvas with a starry backdrop, the game runs as a lightweight desktop app via Tauri, ensuring smooth performance across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Key Features
- **Gameplay**: Control the X-Wing with arrow keys to move and spacebar to fire lasers (with sound). Destroy TIE Fighters for points (10 per hit) and avoid collisions to survive.
- **Aesthetic**: Star Wars-themed sprites (X-Wing, TIE Fighters, lasers) and audio (laser shots, explosions) create an authentic experience, set against a starry background.
- **Technical Foundation**: Built with HTML5, JavaScript, and Canvas API, bundled with Tauri for cross-platform desktop use. Assets are loaded asynchronously for smooth rendering.
- **Extensibility**: Designed for future enhancements (e.g., background music, power-ups) while maintaining modularity.

### Success Criteria
- Deliver a stable game with smooth controls, reliable collision detection, and functioning assets (sprites and audio).
- Achieve cross-platform compatibility via Tauri with consistent performance.
- Create an immersive Star Wars experience with legally sourced or created assets for personal use.
- Maintain a codebase adhering to `coding-standards.md` for scalability and ease of maintenance.

This game is a personal tribute to the Star Wars universe, bringing iconic space battles to your desktop for private enjoyment.
